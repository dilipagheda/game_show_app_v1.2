# Phrase Hunter - A Word Game (Frontend Project)
This project is done as part of Treehouse Front-End and Full stack JS Techdegree. Initially it was implemented as pure function based and later was refactored using ES6 OOP style using classes. Its about creating a word game where player can guess a letter in the random word. Player has upto 5 lives and game is lost if all 5 lives are used. If player guesses all letters of the word within 5 lives then player wins!

# Custom styles implemented
- Extensively used a library called animate.js (http://daneden.me/animate) to use bounce, pulse and rubberBand animations. See how Start Game button, phrases buttons, keyboard buttons and game result message (win/lose) animates.
- Implemented a physical keyboard listener and tied it up to virtual keyboard. So, if user presses physical key a or A then it is same as if user has clicked A button on virtual keyboard.
